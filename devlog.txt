- wrote launch codes in readme
- updated requirements
- updated site headings
- wrote site description
- we chose the due date to be the 12th because we believed that with the two days off in
  addition with the amount of class time we are given, we should have a good shot at completing
  before the 11th, with the 11th as the safety net in case something breaks.

qinaL -- 2021-10-29 13:42

- able to display register ability (username, password, confirm password) to users
    - but does not actually register them to the database nor checks for fails (username in use, passwords don't match)

noakaiA -- 2021-11-03 23:19
- made the password fields in the templated actual password fields for the epic dots
- authentication works now, in all aspects
  - creating users
  - authenticating those users
  - updating and changing the database
  - can actually check if a username is already in the db now (previous way of checking didn't work).
    - This prevents logins from unregistered users and prevents duplicate usernames from registering.
- this took too long and there were too many stupid bugs and friking eric with the friking merge conflicts (jk) (sorta).
- I need to clean this up and add comments later but it works good enough for now and my brain hurts.

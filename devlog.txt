- wrote launch codes in readme
- updated requirements
- updated site headings
- wrote site description
- we chose the due date to be the 12th because we believed that with the two days off in
  addition with the amount of class time we are given, we should have a good shot at completing
  before the 11th, with the 11th as the safety net in case something breaks.

qinaL -- 2021-10-29 13:42
- fixed design_wiki1.pdf to be the design doc of the other trio (that makes up this team of 4)

andrewJ -- 2021-11-2 21:22

qinaL -- 2021-11-02 21:42
- added "/register" route
- created register.html
- added register button to landing page/login page
- able to display register ability (username, password, confirm password) to users
    - but does not actually register them to the database nor checks for fails (username in use, passwords don't match)

andrewJ, noakaiA, ericG, qinaL -- 2021-11-3 9:17
- implemented create_user
- edited register template
- allowed editing of database
- started auth_user

qinaL -- 2021-11-03 17:43
- added "/rAuth" route in main.py to autheticate registration of users
- now checks for when passwords don't match
- added in register.html fail conditions (mismatch, taken) that when set to true displays corresponding error (passwords don't match, username is taken)
  - mismatch can be triggered
  - taken can't be triggered yet because there was an error with create_user

andrewJ -- 2021-11-03 19:20
- updated register template
- renamed functions in main to better fit

ericG -- 2021-11-03 23:15
- created "create blog" template
- added route to creating blogs
- fixed merge conflict

noakaiA -- 2021-11-03 23:19
- made the password fields in the templated actual password fields for the epic dots
- authentication works now, in all aspects
  - creating users
  - authenticating those users
  - updating and changing the database
  - can actually check if a username is already in the db now (previous way of checking didn't work).
    - This prevents logins from unregistered users and prevents duplicate usernames from registering.
- this took too long and there were too many stupid bugs and friking eric with the friking merge conflicts (jk) (sorta).
- I need to clean this up and add comments later but it works good enough for now and my brain hurts.

andrewJ -- 2021-11-04 9:05

- registration success words changed

- now tells users specific error tht they didnt input username or password
- registration should be done
  - checks for when no username is inputted, no password is inputted, when passwords don't match, and when the username is taken
  - if there are no fails, account is created and user is sent back to login page with instructions saying to login, and login is useful

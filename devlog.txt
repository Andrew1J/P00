- wrote launch codes in readme
- updated requirements
- updated site headings
- wrote site description
- we chose the due date to be the 12th because we believed that with the two days off in 
  addition with the amount of class time we are given, we should have a good shot at completing 
  before the 11th, with the 11th as the safety net in case something breaks.

  - mismatch can be triggered
